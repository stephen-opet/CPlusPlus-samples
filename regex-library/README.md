This program reads a file in the working directory (named regex.txt here),

parses the file for valid C++ class identifiers,

and prints results to the screen

Implementation shown here can handle up to 2 inherited classes & a multiline class declaration


Designed and tested on UbuntuLinux w/ g++ compiler
