This program demonstrates the following:

	Dynamic memory allocation via new/delete

	copy & move constructor implementation on bitmap class

	Writing a PNG via the nnosvg library

	operator overload


The program uses a comprehensive and straightforward library 

to write a proper PNG image file!!

Doing so from scratch is difficult and ugly

using a bitmap w/ this library is easy and fun!
